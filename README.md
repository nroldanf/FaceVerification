# Face Verification API

API for face verification deployed using FastAPI, Docker in Heroku platform.

## Project Description

This project objective is to implement a face verification API from scratch using pre-trained models from Tensorflow and Pytorch as feature extractors (VGG16, and ResNet) and an Syamese Network architecture. The dataset used is the Fine-grained LFW database that you can found here: http://www.whdeng.cn/FGLFW/FGLFW.html.
